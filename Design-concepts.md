  For my design concepts, I plan to utilize a well-spaced, slightly boxy text design.  I have consulted examples
of several other Zen Garden sites that appeal to me, and am also thinking of including the use of columns 
to layout some of the various textual pieces. 

  While researching this assignment I spent a lot of time looking through images that could be used as the 
background for the pageâ€”a process that I really enjoyed.  I hope to focus on a singular fixed background 
image that evokes a feeling of calmness, peacefulness, and a connection to natural beauty. 

  In general, I like website design that is visually/aesthietically appealing, easy to navigate, and has 
at least a bit of movement/animation. I will incorporate some of those elements to the best of my ability
